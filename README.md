A game of profound icebreakers.

This is meant to be a clone in spirit to the various physical icebreaker card games, with freely licensed content. Because let's be honest, if you have a github account your emotional intelligence probably sucks.

## Building

You need [Vala](https://docs.vala.dev/) and a working install of [fortune](https://linux.die.net/man/6/fortune) -- on most distros this means installing `fortune-mod`.

To build, run

```
make
```

There's a shortcut for testing:

```
make play
```
